</div>

<p class='c008'>Mnemosyne, Hesiod
tells us, was the mother of the Muses.
Without speculating as some have done
about the reasons for this myth it
is interesting as showing an appreciation
of the fundamental nature of
memory and some sort of crude
introspective psychology dating back
possibly to pre-historic times.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the art of writing
was in common use men had to
depend more largely than to-day upon
their memories for preserving and
transmitting their knowledge. It
is not surprising, therefore, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>ancients put a high estimate upon
memory before they began to theorize
about its nature. There are, of
course, allusions to memory in Homer
and in the Hebrew Scriptures.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
And occasionally one of the early
Greek philosophers tries to explain
some phenomenon of memory. But
we find no scientific study of the
subject before Aristotle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The psychology of the Ionian
school of philosophers, as far as they
can be said to have had any at all,
was sensationalism. Their views of
memory must be conjectured from
the fundamental principles of their
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The doctrine of transmigration
as held in the Pythagoreans is an
anticipation of Plato’s doctrine of
reminiscence, but there is little psychology
in it. Theophrastus tells us
that Diogenes of Appollonia was puzzled
by the phenomenon of forgetting
things.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> But he explained it in accordance
with the principles of his philosophy
by supposing that the cause
of forgetting was an arrest of the
equal distribution of air throughout
the body. A corroboration of this explanation
he found in the easier
breathing that follows the recalling
of what was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the Eleatics, Parmenides
is reported to have held that not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>only thought, but recollecting and forgetting
depended upon the way the
light or heat and the dark or cold
are mixed in the body. If we may
trust Theophrastus,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a> it may be assumed
that, according to Parmenides,
every presentation corresponded
to a definite mixture or relation
of these qualities, and with the
destruction of that relation the
presentation disappeared, that is, was
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>Heraclitus, one might suppose, would
study memory carefully, but in the
fragments of his philosophy that have
come down to us nothing is said
upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Plato we find a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>modern psychology. According to him
the thinking power of the mind, the
understanding, is above the mere
power of sense perceptions. It is this
power which compares and considers,
notes similarities and contrasts,
unity and plurality, and forms
ideas of relation between Being and
Non-Being as well as relations of number
and proportions. Among the elements
of this power, recollections
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αναμνησις</span>)<a id='t5'></a> is of prime importance.
This rests upon the association by
similarity and simultaneity.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Plato distinguishes the passive retention
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μνημη</span>) of perceptions from
active memory (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αναμνησις</span>),<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>suggests as a definition of memory,
“the power which the soul has of recovering,
when by itself, some feeling
which it experienced when in company
with the body.” He attempts
no explanation of <del>memory</del>;
but in the Theaetetus puts the
following words into the mouth of
Socrates:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would have you imagine,
then, that there exists in the mind
of man a block of wax, which is
of different sizes in different men;
harder, moister, and having more
or less of purity in one than in
another, and in some of an intermediate
quality.... Let us say
that this tablet is a gift of memory,
the mother of the muses, and
that when we wish to remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>anything which we have seen or
heard, or thought in our own minds,
we hold the wax to the perceptions
and thoughts, and in that receive
the impressions from them as from
the seal of a ring; and that we
remember and know what is imprinted
as long as the image lasts;
but when the image is effaced, or
cannot be taken, then we forget
and do not know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Plato carries out the same figure
to explain different degrees of memory.
“When the wax in one’s soul
is deep, abundant, smooth, and of
the right quality, the impressions are
lasting. Such minds can easily
retain and are not liable to confusion.
But, on the other hand, when
the wax is very soft, one learns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>easily and forgets as easily; if the
wax is hard, the reverse is true;
again, if the wax is hard or impure,
the impressions are indistinct; and
still more indistinct are they when
jostled together in a little soul.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>This illustration must
not be taken too seriously; for later
on in the same dialogue Socrates
calls it a “waxen figment” and
substitutes for it the figure of the
aviary of all kinds of birds—“some
flocking together apart from the rest,
others in small groups, others solitary,
flying anywhere and everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The receptacle is empty when we
are young. The birds are kinds of
knowledge. Learning is the process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of capturing the birds and of detaining
them in this enclosure. In acts
of memory we re-catch them and
take them out of the aviary.</p>

<p class='c009'>Plato’s views upon memory have
a special interest on account of their
connection with his metaphysical
doctrines. Perception and recollection
are the occasion of the minds turning
away from the world of sense
to the inner world of innate and
universal ideas. These ideas we
could never get from sense-perception.
That gives us only the immediate
and the individual. The ideas are
of the essential and the universal.
We could not conceive them if we
did not already know them. Hence
the power to know the universal
in the individual proves a previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>existence in which we had the intuitions
of universal truths; and, accordingly,
learning is but recollection.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
The metaphysical aspects of
memory, however, let us avoid as
much as possible. They would soon
lead far from a psychological study.
But this doctrine of recollection lies
at the heart of the Platonic philosophy,
and it is necessary to note
carefully the distinctions between
this and ordinary memory. The
latter, as defined by Plato in the
passage quoted above is the memory
or recollection of what has been
learned through the body, that is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>through sense-perception, belongs to
the world of appearances, and is liable
to many errors. The former, on
the other hand, is not concerned
with things of sense. It is recollection
of that higher world where we
had an antenatal vision of intelligible
realities. Its highest manifestation
is the insight of the philosopher
who sees the divine goodness,
truth, and beauty.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The difference in philosophic
method between Plato and
Aristotle is well illustrated by their
treatment of memory. What Plato
says of memory is incidental to
the discussion of such profound matters
as the nature of the soul and
the theory of knowledge. Memory, according
to him, is one of the higher
faculties and partakes of the eternal
nature of the soul. Aristotle
makes a special study of memory
in a less transcendental way. With
him it is no longer a function
of the eternal <span class='under'>Nous</span>; but it has
its seat in the passive Reason, is
dependent upon a physiological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>process, and perishes with the body.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aristotle seems to have
been the first of ancient philosophers
to write a systematic treatise
on psychology. But, rather curiously,
in this work on psychology
there is no special treatment
of memory. A special tract, however,
was devoted to the special tract, however,
was devoted to the subject.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a> This,
so far as we know, was the first
scientific study of memory; and
for this reason, as well as for its
intrinsic merits, the tract deserves
special attention. But before passing
to his doctrine of memory, it
is well to notice briefly his Theory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>of sense-perceptions. On occasion
of appropriate stimuli movements
take place in the sense-organs. These
movements, however, are not sense
perceptions. In perceptions the mind
must compare and distinguish disparate
sensations; it must unite
the sensations presented simultaneously
by our double sense organs
as of sight and hearing, and it
must be conscious of sensations.
This work of comparisons, of psychic
synthesis, and of self-conscious
perception is performed by a central
sense. The physical basis of
this sense is the heart. Through
it the mind performs the act of
sense perception. The functions now
attributed to nervous substance are
referred by Aristotle to the <span class='under'>pneuma</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>connected with the blood. This is
the medium by which the movements
arising in the sense organs
are transmitted to the heart, and
in this <span class='under'>pneuma</span> the movements
persist long after the external stimuli
have ceased to act. Incidentally,
it is interesting to note, that
according to Aristotle’s psychology, the
brain has very little to do with
mental activity. To borrow a phrase
from Wallace, it serves simply as
“a cooling apparatus to counteract the
excessive warmth of the heart.”  When
the movement occasioned in the
sense organ by an external stimulus
is propagated to the heart,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>becomes a perception of the soul. Sense
perception, then, is an act of the
soul by means of a physiological process.
In the words of Aristotle it is
“a movement of the soul through
the body.”<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Now this movement
sometimes continues after the
stimulus, which was the occasion
of it, has ceased to act. The extreme
case is the well known phenomenon
of a visual after-image. The
images of the imagination are
such after-sensations. Imagination
is weak sensation, or in the words
of Hobbes, “decaying sense”. So too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>dreaming is the result of a movement
in our bodily organs, caused
either from without or from
within. Again, these persisting movements
are the elements of memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first, one wonders how Aristotle
will distinguish those movements
which constitute memory
from those which are the basis of
imagination. He is not entirely
satisfactory on this point; but he
makes the following distinction.
The picture of the imagination, or the
corresponding movement does not
refer to an external object, and
is not located in the past. The
memory picture, on the other hand,
does refer to an object and carries
with it the consciousness of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>time in the past, when the perception
remembered took place.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Memory,
then, involves time, and both
this and the sense of time are
<span class='under'>dependent</span> upon the central sense.
Memory, as we have seen, is dependent
upon the residua of sensations.
The subjective side of a sensation
is an image. Thus memory
belongs to the same part of
the soul as the imagination,
and the proper objects <ins>of memory</ins> are images
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φανταστα</span>). The image is a condition
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παθος</span>) of the central sense.
Memory <span class='under'>per se</span> is of the original
image or perception, and only in
an accidental manner does it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>relate to matters of thought.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In his special tract on
memory, Aristotle in part repeats
Plato’s views, in part discusses
the obvious facts of memory,
which, having been continually
repeated since his time, have
become mere platitudes, and in
part he tries to explain the phenomena
of memory in accordance
with his general system
of psychology. The essay, however,
is of special interest, because
in it Aristotle sets forth very
clearly the famous doctrine of
association of ideas. Some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the other points in the treatise
may be briefly mentioned and
special consideration given to
the portion relating to recollection
and association. ¶ First Aristotle
takes considerable space
to show what would seem to
be apparent enough to everybody,
that memory is of the past,
as perception is of the present,
and hope and opinion of the future.</p>

<p class='c009'>The central sense or sensorium
must be in a condition
suitable to receive and retain
impressions. If the sensorium
is too hard, no impression
is made. If it is greatly agitated,
the new movement is ineffectual: on somewhat the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>same principles, one may suppose,
as one may in modern psychology,
that a weak stimulus
is washed out by a strong one.
Hence the very young and the
very old have poor memories; for
the former are in the movement
of growth, the latter in that of
decay. Again, the question arises:
How is it that in recollection we
recognize the memory image as
a picture of the absent object?
A scholastic answer is given.
“An animal painted in a picture,
he says, is both an animal
and a copy, and while being thus
one and the same, it is nevertheless
two things at once. The
animal and the copy are not
identical, and we may think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of the picture either as animal
or as a representation. This is
also true of the image within
us; and the idea which the
mind contemplates is something,
although it is also the image of
something else.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The second chapter of the
treatise on memory is devoted
chiefly to recollection and the association
of ideas. Aristotle distinguishes
carefully <del>between</del> the
mere persistence and reproduction
of a presentation (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μνημη</span>) from voluntary
recollection (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αναμνησις</span>). The
latter is indirect reproduction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>It is possible only by the association
of ideas. The former is an
attribute of animals, while the
latter is peculiar to man. Recollection
occurs according to the
sequence of ideas.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a> What and how
necessary the sequence shall be depends
upon our past experience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“If the sequence be necessary”, Aristotle
continues, “then, when this movement
occurs, that one will follow.
If it is not necessary, but a matter
of habit, the latter movement
will generally follow.” Sir W<sup>m</sup>. Hamilton
understands the word translated
<span class='under'>movement</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κινησις</span>) to mean
merely <span class='under'>change in quality</span>. The
word, then, he thinks may be fairly
translated into modern nomenclature
by his famous term
<span class='under'>modification</span>. One hesitates to
criticise such a profound scholar
and such a diligent student
of Aristotle as Sir W<sup>m</sup>. Hamilton;
but in the light of what has been
said it seems much simpler
and more in accordance with
the psychology of Aristotle to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>his doctrine of recollection
as follows: The physiological
movements originally connected
with a series of perceptions must
occur again in the same order
when we recall a true memory-picture.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Man is so constituted
that when one movement and
the mental image connected with
it occur, another movement with
its appropriate mental image is
likely to follow. When we would
recall anything, therefore, we must
call up idea after idea until we
arrive at one upon which the
one we are in search of has often
been sequent in our experience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Or in terms of physiology, movement
after movement must recur until
we arrive at a movement upon
which the movement corresponding
to the idea desired has often
been sequent.</p>

<p class='c009'>This sequence or association
of ideas is subject to certain
laws. The remarkable passage
in which Aristotle states
these laws is translated by Sir
W<sup>m</sup>. Hamilton as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When, therefore, we accomplish
an act of Reminiscence we pass
through a certain series of precursive
movements until we
arrive at a movement, on which
the one we are in quest of is
habitually consequent. Hence, too,
it is that we hunt through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the mental train, excogitating [what
we seek] from [its concomitant
in] <span class='under'>the present</span>, <span class='under'>or some other time</span>
and from its <span class='under'>Similar</span> or <span class='under'>Contrary</span>
or <span class='under'>Coadjacent</span>. Through this
process Reminiscence is effected.
For the movements,
[which and by which we recollect]
are, in these cases, <del>and</del> sometimes
the <span class='under'>same</span>, sometimes at
<span class='under'>the same time</span>, sometimes <span class='under'>parts
of the same whole</span>: so that [having
obtained from one or the other
of these a commencement], the
subsequent movement is already
more than half accomplished.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Wallace quotes the same
passage in the introduction to
his Psychology of Aristotle,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and gives
the following somewhat different
and probably more accurate translation:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“When engaged in recollection
we seek to excite some of our
previous movements until one
came to that which the movement
or impression of which
we are in search was wont to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>follow. And hence we seek to
reach this preceding impression
by starting in our thought from
an object present to us or something
else whether it be similar,
contrary, or contiguous to that
of which we are in search; recollection
taking place in this
manner because the movements
are in one case identical, in
another case coincident and in
the last case partly overlap.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>Whichever translation we
adopt it seems plain enough that
Aristotle maintained that voluntary
recollection depended upon
the laws of association by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><span class='under'>similarity</span>, <span class='under'>contrast</span> or <span class='under'>contrariety</span>,
and <span class='under'>contiguity</span>. Very likely he
meant to include simultaneity
and sequence; but any proof of
this should rest upon the general
import of the passage rather
than upon any doubtful emendation
like Hamilton’s.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>A more important question
is whether Aristotle meant
to limit the applications of these
laws to voluntary recollection
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αναμνυσις</span>), or whether he intended
to include spontaneous
reproduction (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μνημη</span>) as well.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>The opinion commonly
held by students of Aristotle,
from Themistius down, has
been that he applied the law
of association only to voluntary
recollection. Hamilton,
however, argues forcibly that
Aristotle taught the universality
of the law of association.
It seems natural enough to
suppose that one who saw so
clearly that in the voluntary
train of thought the sequence
conforms to the law of association,
would have seen that
the same laws apply to the
spontaneous activity of the
mind. But while Aristotle
states the law of association
clearly for the former, he at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>most merely alludes to the latter,
and obscurely enough at
that. Later in the same treatise
Aristotle gives an illustration
that may serve to
elucidate the principles of association
that have just been
stated. In recollection there
are certain movements which
serve as standpoints or clues.
Milk suggests whiteness, whiteness
the clear atmosphere, <ins>the atmosphere moisture,</ins> this
the rainy season. So too, Themistius
in commenting upon
the passage quoted above, uses
an illustration somewhat
similar. “I see a painted lyre,
and moved by this, as the
prior and leading image, I
have the reminiscence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>a <span class='under'>real lyre</span>; this suggests the
<span class='under'>musician</span>, and the musician,
the song I heard him play.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
Again, Aristotle uses an illustration
somewhat as follows:
Let A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, represent a
series of ideas, one of which
we will need<a id='t33'></a> to recall. From D E,
as a starting point we may
be moved forward by E or
backward by D, by the association
of ideas. If, then, on the
suggestion of D E, we do not
find what we would recall,
we may find it by running
over the series E ... H; if not,
we shall at any rate find the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>desired idea by running over
the series backward from D to A.
Not much stress, however, should
be put upon this last illustration;
for the text is so obscure
that many different interpretations
have been given by
commentators. Perhaps Aristotle
meant to illustrate something
more profound than the mere
linkings of presentations in
a series, and the process of
recollecting the mental train.
But the illustration of such
a simple matter as this was
not unimportant in the first
scientific study of memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The place of memory
in the Aristotelian psychology
in relation to the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>psychic activities is plain from
what has been said. The relation
of memory, as voluntary
recollection, to the higher activity
of the Nous is indicated by
Aristotle when he says that
recollection is a syllogistic
process. Thus it is that,
while many animals have the
lower kind of memory, man
alone has the higher form.
“The reason is”, says Aristotle,
“that Reminiscence is, as it were,
a kind of syllogism, or mental
discourse. For he who is
reminiscent, that he has formerly
seen or heard, or otherwise perceived,
anything virtually performs an act
of syllogism.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a> With Aristotle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the higher functions of the soul
are based upon the lower.
“Without nutrition, there is no
sense; without sense there is no
phantasy; without phantasy there
is no cogitation or intelligence.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
The place of memory
among the soul’s functions is,
with the phantasy or imagination,
mediate between sensation
and intelligence.</p>

<p class='c009'>In connection with Aristotle’s
<ins>doctrine</ins> of recollections, one passage
in his Psychology is interesting, although its importance
has, perhaps, been exaggerated.
“Recollection,” he says, “starts
from the soul and terminates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>in the movements or impressions
which are stored up in
the organs of sense.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Siebeck
interprets this passage as meaning
that the soul has the
power by means of the heart to
effect a sort of efferent movement
towards the sense organs
and thus to arouse anew the
persisting residua of former motions.
Recollection, then, with Aristotle
as in modern psychology, is an excitation
of the sense organs, reproduced
in a less degree; and the
same organs are excited and the
same movements repeated as in
the original sensation.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> This passage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>is certainly a remarkable anticipation
of Bain’s famous doctrine
that a reproduced impression
“occupies the very same parts
and in the same manner” as the
original impression.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>In the foregoing sketch
of Aristotle’s view of memory the
attempt has been made to give
only what can fairly be found
in Aristotle’s text. Much of his
tract upon memory is obscure.
Commentators have held very
conflicting opinions in regard
to the importance of what he
wrote upon association and
recollection. Sir W<sup>m</sup>. Hamilton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>calls him “the founder and finisher
of the theory of Association,”
looks upon the commentators as
marvellously stupid in their interpretations,
and deems it a proof
of Aristotle’s genius that it took
the world 2000 years to become
intelligent enough to understand
him. Indeed, in reading Hamilton’s
erudite discussion one
may be led almost to believing
that Aristotle was the first Scottish
philosopher. But while Hamilton’s
Scottish apperception probably found
too much in Aristotle’s treatise,
and while, on the other hand,
Lewes may be right in saying
that “here as in so many
other cases modern knowledge
supplies the telescope with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>lenses”, nevertheless Aristotle’s doctrine
of association was a valuable
contribution to science.
And it is manifestly unfair
to charge him with ignorance
of its importance, because he
did not spin out as many
volumes upon the subject as
the English associationalists have
done.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Stoics took
Plato’s figure of the wax almost
literally! They held that the
mind is originally a <span class='under'>tabula
rasa</span>. Sensations are the first
writing upon this tablet. The object
of sensation makes an
impression upon the perceiving
subject, as the seal impresses
the wax. Memory depends upon
this impression. This was
the view of Zeno. Chrysippus
found difficulties in such a
crude materialistic theory. How
could the mind receive and retain
at the same time a
number of different and partly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>incompatible impressions? Accordingly
he replaced this view by the
theory that the sense impression
consists in <ins>a</ins> qualitative change
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αλλοιωσις</span>) of the passively receiving
organ, the soul.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The presentation
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαντασια</span>) is a state of
the soul. The relation of memory
to the general theory of knowledge
with the Stoics was briefly
as follows:—The lowest act of
the soul is mere perception (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αισθησις</span>);
the next is presentation
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαντασια</span>), which adds conscious
observation, its functions being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to make a first test of the
truth of the material furnished
by sense. If perception has
offered a true picture of the
external object, this presenting
activity of the mind becomes
so intensive that the understanding
is brought into action.
The understanding or judgment
approves or disapproves
the presentations. If it approves,
there arises the empirical fact,
which bears upon it the mark
of truth. These facts memory
stores up. By combination of
the separate facts empirical concepts
are formed which make up the
treasure of memory or experience.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The psychology of Epicurus
and the other atomists
was a simple kind of mechanical
sensationalism. <span class='under'>Eidola</span> or
images from external objects enter
the soul through the sense
organs. The mind stores up
a great multitude of these eidola.
Whenever we call up a picture
of memory or of the imagination,
we turn the attention to
one of these images. Thus the
mind sees in the same way
that the eye does, with this
difference, that it perceives much
thinner eidola.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Cicero and Quintilian
both dwell upon the importance
of memory; and both seem to
adopt the common theory of the
time, that impressions are
stamped on the mind as the
signets are marked on wax.
They are especially concerned,
however, with principles relating
to the exercise of memory; and
they give instructions for mnemonic
aids in oratory. Cicero
lays special stress upon order
as an aid to memory; and as
sight is the most acute of the
senses, those things are best
remembered which are visualized
by the imagination. In
accordance with the ancient
mnemonic systems he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>have these imagined forms localized.
The advice of Quintilian
in respect to memory is
especially sensible. According to
him, nothing can take the place
of exercise and labor. Next in
importance is the division and
arrangement of one’s subject. He
notices also the importance of
good health; and says that for
slow minds an interval of
rest is a good thing, though he
seems to be uncertain whether the
advantage is due to the rest,
or whether it gives reminiscence
time to mature.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Neo-Platonic psychology
of memory is represented
by Plotinus.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a> He discusses
the subject at considerable
length, and presents a somewhat
original doctrine. Memory
does not belong to God nor to
the divine immutable intelligence
in man, which knows
by direct intellectual perceptions.
It is a function of the soul
and first appears when the
world soul is individualized
in bodies. Memory, however, has
no basis in the physical organism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>nor does the soul impress
the sensations upon the body.
The effects of sensations are
not like impressions made
by a seal, nor are they reactions
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αντερεισεις</span>), or configurations
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τυπωσεις</span>), but in sense-perception
as in thought the soul is
active. In memory, too, the
soul is active, not passive.
The influence of the body proves
nothing against this. The changeable
nature of the body may
cause us to forget, but it cannot
condition positive recollection.
The body is the river of
Lethe, but memory belongs to the
soul. The part of the soul to
which memory belongs is the
image-forming faculty. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>holds sense impressions as well
as thought. Two souls, the
higher and the lower, are concerned
in memory. When the
soul leaves the body, the recollections
of the lower soul are
soon forgotten in proportion
as the higher soul rises toward
the intelligible world.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>St. Augustine developed
the views of the Neo-Platonists
in regard to memory. With him
memory is a faculty of animals,
men, and angels. God,
whose immutable essence is
above the sphere of movement
and change, does not remember.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Everything is seen by him in
one indivisible and unchangeable
present.</p>

<p class='c009'>Augustine does not agree
with Aristotle that some animals
are devoid of memory. He attributes
memory even to fishes, and
relates in confirmation of
this opinion an incident that
he had observed. There was a
large fountain filled with fishes.
People came daily to see them and
often fed them. The fishes remembered
what they received;
and as soon as any one came
to the fountain they crowded together
expecting their accustomed
food. But Augustine does not
suppose that animals have that
higher memory which is purely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>intellectual, although he probably
failed to see how purely mechanical
and involuntary their so-called
acts of memory are. Memory
with St. Augustine, as in the
psychology of Plotinus, is a function
of the soul, not of the body.
But <ins>with</ins> Aristotle <ins>he</ins> refers it to the
central sense.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>What is memory? It is
thinking of what one knows. All
the various modifications of the
soul cannot all be present to
us at once. There is a difference
between knowing a thing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>thinking of it. The musician, says
Augustine, knows music, but he
does not think of it when he is
talking about Geometry.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> The ideas
relating to music are in the
mind in a latent state. Augustine
anticipates Leibnitz in discussing
the unconscious modifications
of our <del>own</del> ideas; but he
speaks especially of their gradual decay,
while Leibnitz considers the
unconscious growth of them. “Many
numbers”,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Augustine says, “are gradually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>effaced from memory; for
they remain not an instant unaltered.
Indeed what is not found
in memory after a year is somewhat
diminished even after one
day. But this diminution is imperceptible;
yet it is not wrongly
inferred; for it does not suddenly
all vanish the day before
the year is up. Hence we may
conclude that from the moment
it was engraved in memory it
began to slip away.”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> This doctrine
of unconscious mental
changes and unconscious mental
states is one of the most
remarkable features of Augustine’s
psychology. With irresistible logic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>he demonstrates the existence
of such states in the following
passage from another place:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what when the
memory itself loses anything, as
falls out when we forget and
seek that we may recollect? Where,
in the end, do we search, but
in the memory itself? And there,
if one thing be, perchance, offered
instead of another, we reject it,
until what we seek meets us;
and when it doth we say ‘This
is it’; which we should not
unless we recognized it, nor
recognize it, unless we remembered
it——For we do not
believe it as something new,
but upon recollection, allow
what was named to be right.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>But were it utterly blotted out
of the mind, we should not
remember it, even when reminded.
For we have not as
yet utterly forgotten that which
we remember ourselves to have
forgotten. What, then, we have utterly
forgotten, though lost, we
cannot even seek after.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> It would
not be difficult to find passages
in modern psychologies that read
almost like translations of
this chapter of Augustine’s Confessions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two kinds of memory—sense memory and intellectual
memory are distinguished
in the Augustinian psychology.
The former preserves and reproduces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>not only the images
of visible objects, but also the
impressions of sounds, odors
and other objects which strike
our senses.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> The images are
not like the <span class='under'>eidola</span> of Democritus,
but are ideal, formed by
the mind from its own essence.
Intellectual memory contains
our knowledge of the sciences, of
literature, and dialectic, and of
the questions relating to these
subjects.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a> This memory, unlike
the memory of sense, contains
not the images of things, but
the things themselves. These ideas
which the intellectual memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>stores up are in a sense innate.
They never came to us
through the senses. They could
never have been taught to us, unless
we had already had them in
our memories. “When I learned
them I gave not credit to another
man’s mind, but recognized
them in mine.” Thus
the memory contains the idea
of truth and of God.</p>

<p class='c009'>Augustine points out,
too, what has been repeated by
Locke and others until it has
become a platitude, that we
do not remember objects themselves,
but the ideas which we
have gained from them. And with
his usual subtlety he shows that
much of what is ordinarily attributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>to perception is really the
work of memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We see what importance
St. Augustine attaches to memory.
It is in his view the faculty
which preserves the ideas relating
<ins>not</ins> only to the body, but to
the soul, not only to eternal
truths, but to the Eternal Being
himself ——. This memory,
which is peculiar to man, and
which animals do not possess—this
memory, which in a mysterious
manner contains in
it intelligible realities, is, according
to the Bishop of Hippo, one of
the three great faculties of man,
and the origin of the other two.
It is from it that intelligence
arises, and the will proceeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>from the one to the other and
unites them. Thus, if it is allowed
to compare things human
with things divine, we
have in us an image of the
august Trinity. Memory, in which
is the matter of knowledge, and
which is as the place of intelligible
things, offers some resemblance
to the Father; the intellect,
which is derived <del>from</del>
and formed from it, is not
without analogy to the Son; and
love or will, which unites the intelligible
(or memory) to the intellect
has a certain resemblance
to the Holy Spirit.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> The phenomena
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of memory were also important
with Augustine as weapons
against materialism. By memory
the soul knows objects of
sense when it no longer perceives
them, and, moreover, combines
the heterogeneous in ways
inexplicable by means of a phys<del>ch</del>ical
substance. And again the
soul can form abstract conceptions
of space and mathematical
truths.</p>

<p class='c009'>The well-known conditions
of a good memory, such
as acuteness of sensation, order,
and repetition, Augustine notices
only incidentally. More attention
is given to the relation of the
will to memory and to the association
of ideas.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Whether we remember
or not depends upon the will. By
an act of will we avert the
memory from sense-perceptions,
as, for example, when we hear
a speaker and do not notice
what he says, or read
a page and do not know
what we have read, or walk
with our attention upon something
else. In all these cases
we perceive, but do not remember
our perceptions. So, too,
recollection depends upon the
will: “As the will applies <ins>sense to the</ins>
body (or external object), so it
applies the memory to the sense,
and the eye of the mind of
the thinker to the memory.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>This power of the will
over memory is, however, limited
by the association of ideas.
In order to recall anything by
a voluntary effort we must
remember the general notion
of the thing or some associated
idea. “For example, if I
wish to remember what I
supped on yesterday, either I
have already remembered that
I did sup, or if not yet this,
at least, I have remembered
something about that time itself,
if nothing else; at all
events, I have remembered
yesterday and that part of yesterday
in which people usually
sup, and what supping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>is.”<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a> In another place he
says that, of a series of ideas
the lost part is recovered
“by the part whereof we had hold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Many since Augustine
have marvelled at the miracle
of memory. None have expressed
their admiration more eloquently.
“Great is this force of
memory”, he exclaims, “excessive
great, O my God; a large
and boundless chamber; who
ever sounded the bottom thereof?
Yet is this a power of mine,
and belongs unto my nature;
nor do I myself comprehend all
that I am. Therefore is the
mind too strait to contain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>itself. And where should that be
which it containeth, not of itself?
Is it without and not
within? How then doth it not
comprehend itself. A wonderful
admiration surprises me, amazement
seizes me upon this.
And men go abroad to admire
the heights of mountains, the
mighty billows of the sea, the
broad tides of rivers, the compass
of the ocean, and the circuits
of the stars, and pass themselves
by; nor wonder that
when I spake of all these things,
I did not see them with my
eyes, yet could not have spoken
of them, unless I then actually
saw the mountains, billows,
rivers, stars, which I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>seen, and that ocean which I
believe to be inwardly in my
memory, and that, with the
vast spaces between, as if I
saw them abroad. Yet did
not I by seeing draw them into
myself, when with mine eyes
I beheld them; nor are they themselves
with me, but their images
only. And I know by what sense
of the body, each was impressed
upon me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is an interesting
fact that Augustine noticed the
possibility of illusions of memory.
Certain rare phenomena—the
so-called recollections of Pythagoras
and others who were said
to have remembered objects perceived
in a former state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>existence—he explains in a
very modern fashion, except
that he attributes <ins>these</ins> beliefs to the
agency of evil spirits. “For we
must not”, he says, “acquiesce
in their story who assert that
the Samian Pythagoras recollected
some things of this kind, which
he had experienced when he
was previously here in another
body; and others <ins>tell</ins> yet of others,
that they experienced something
of the same sort in their minds.
But it may be conjectured that
these were untrue recollections,
such as we commonly experience
in sleep, when we fancy
we remember, as though
we had done or seen it, when
we never did or saw at all;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and that the minds of these
persons, even though awake, were
affected in this way at the
suggestion of malicious and
deceitful spirits, whose care it
is to confirm, or to sow some
false belief concerning the changes
of souls, in order to deceive
men.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a> If they truly remembered
such things, he argues, such
phenomena would not be as
rare; but many persons would
experience the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps the most serious
criticism of Augustine’s psychology
of memory is that he
entirely neglects the physiological
side of the subject. He does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>even notice the relations of memory
to states of health or disease,
and of youth or age. In one place,
however, he states that memory
has its seat in one of the three
ventricles of the brain, which is
situated between that which is
the seat of sensation and that
which presides <ins>over</ins> <del>of</del> locomotion, so
that our movements may be coordinated.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>The criticism has also
been made that Augustine seems
to waver in his conception of
memory, that he sometimes represents
it as the source of all
our intellectual activity comparing
it among the other faculties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to the Father in the Trinity; that
again he seems to limit this
faculty to the work of preserving
knowledge acquired empirically. Certainly
in some passages he seems
to make memory contain a
kind of innate ideas that may
be drawn forth by suggestion.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>But if Augustine is unsatisfactory
in this, it must be remembered
that he is not writing
a psychology and that he
was, as Ferraz calls him, a
philosopher of transitions. “He combats
Plato’s doctrine of reminiscence,
and prepares the way for the
innate ideas of Descartes, without
positively enough rejecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the former, and without clearly
enough admitting the latter.”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The pathological side
of memory seems to have been
little studied by the ancients.
Augustine referred to the possibility
of illusions of memory in the way
already mentioned. Senaca tells
of a certain Sabinus who had so
bad a memory that he forgot the
name of Ulysses, and again of
Achilles, and sometimes of Priam,
though he knew them as well as
we remember our schoolmasters.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
Some remarkable cases of amnesia
were reported to the Elder Pliny.
“Nothing whatever in man,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>says, “is of so frail a nature as
the memory; for it is affected by
disease, by injuries, and even
by fright; being sometimes partially
lost and at <ins>other</ins> times entirely
so. A man who received a
blow from a stone forgot the names
of the letters (of the alphabet) only; while,
on the other hand, another person,
who fell from a very high roof
could not so much as recollect
his mother or his relations and
neighbors. Another person in consequence
of some disease forgot his
own servants even; and Messala
Corvinus, the orator, lost all recollection
of his own name.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a> While
these cases are good illustrations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of certain diseases of memory,
they are not reported with sufficient
accuracy and detail to
render them of much scientific
value. Ancient thinkers appear
not to have seen the importance
of studying the pathological conditions
of memory.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>
  <h2 class='c003'>VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>No historical sketch of
memory among the ancient Greeks and
Romans is complete without some
mention of their mnemonic systems.
The art of mnemonics seems to
have been much in vogue among
them. There are frequent allusions
to this art in the works of Aristotle,
Plato, and other classic writers.
Aristotle is reported by some
to have written a work upon
mnemonics. Every scholar of the
classics is familiar with the
story that ascribes the invention
of the art to Simonides.</p>

<p class='c009'>The main principles of
the ancient mnemonic systems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>according to Cicero and Quintilian
were as follows. The thing to be
remembered was localized by the
imagination in some definite
place—say in a room of a
real or imaginary house; and, if
necessary, a concrete symbol as
vivid as possible was associated
with it. This method was used
by the Romans as an aid in
oratory; and it has been said that
the phrases, “<span class='under'>in the first place</span>,” “<span class='under'>in the
second place</span>,” and the like, originated
in this ancient practice.</p>

<p class='c009'>The ancient systems of
mnemonics are inferior to the
best modern systems, that, <ins>since</ins> the
days of Pick<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a> have been based upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>sound psychological principles.
But the ancient systems were probably
very helpful <ins>to</ins> eye-minded
people. The men with remarkable
memories, mentioned by Cicero
and other ancient writers
very likely owed much to mnemonic
aids. It is of special psychological
interest to consider
the ancient mnemonic devices
in the light of such studies as
those of Galton upon mental
imagery, number forms, and the
like.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a>  The high estimate that many
of the ancients placed upon the
mnemonic art, may, perhaps, fairly
be taken as evidence that what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Galton calls the faculty of visualisation
was developed among them.
Especially some of the Roman
orators seem to have possessed
this faculty in a high degree.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was born at Dunbarton, N.H. on the 3d
of Dec. 1855, and am the youngest son of
Samuel and Hannah Dane Burnham. I graduated
at the High School at Manchester,
N.H. in 1875. The next three years I
spent in teaching and in study. In
1878 I entered Harvard College, and graduated
in the Class of ’82. The following
year was spent in teaching in the Preparatory
Department of Wittenberg College. The
next two years were spent at the State
Normal School at Potsdam, N.Y., where my
work was the teaching of Latin and Rhetoric. In
1885 I entered the Johns Hopkins University.
In this university I have held the position of
Fellow in Philosophy and Fellow by Courtesy.
My work has been chiefly under the direction

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
